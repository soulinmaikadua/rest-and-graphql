```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Basic routing

```javascript
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);
```

- `app` is an instance of express.
- `METHOD` is and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods" target="_blank">HTTP request method</a>, in lowercase.
- `PATH` is a path on the server.
- `HANDLER` is the function executed when the route is matached.

The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.

Respond with `Hello World` on the homepage.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

Respond to POST request on the root route (/), the application's home page

```javascript
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Got a POST request");
});
```

Respond to a PUT request to the /user route:

```javascript
app.put("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Got a PUT request at /user");
});
```

Respond to a DELETE request to the /user route:

```javascript
app.delete("/user", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Got a DELETE request at /user");
});
```
